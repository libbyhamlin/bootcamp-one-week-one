            <h1>Hi there!</h1>

            <img class="lib-pic" src="./about-me/libby-blue-hat.jpg" alt="It's me with a blue hat!">
            
           
            <p> Recently, I developed a strong interest in
                front-end
                programing. <br>To pursue this interest I left my job this fall to
                enroll in Alchemy Code Lab, a code bootcamp base in Portland,
                OR.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Alchemy, I will learn the following programing languages:
                <ol>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ol>
            </p>  

            <p>Once I complete the course, I will be able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>build apps</li>
                    <li>create websites</li>
                    <li>build something useful</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>For fun, I play guitar in a band called Internet
                Beef
                and Shannon Entropy.<br>Internet Beef recently released a four song
                EP
                called Free Trial. <br>I also enjoy roller skating, biking, hiking,
                and
                watching tv shows.<br> Oh and this past weekend I colored my hair
                bright
                green, but my favorite color is orange.
